## Abstract
UtsavMunch is a modern, web-based Event Management System designed to streamline the process of organizing, managing, and participating in events. The platform addresses the growing need for digital solutions in the event industry, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for users, vendors, and administrators. Users can browse a wide range of event services, book vendors, and manage their bookings through an intuitive interface. Vendors are empowered to showcase their offerings, manage bookings, and interact with potential clients, while administrators maintain oversight of the platform's operations, ensuring a secure and efficient environment for all stakeholders.

The system leverages a robust technology stack, featuring a React.js frontend for dynamic user experiences, a Node.js/Express backend for scalable API services, and a MongoDB database for efficient data management. UtsavMunch distinguishes itself through its modular architecture, enabling seamless integration of future enhancements such as real-time chat and secure online payments. The platform's design prioritizes usability, security, and scalability, making it adaptable to a diverse range of event types and sizes.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of UtsavMunch, detailing its functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, implementation strategies, and evaluation metrics. The document also explores the challenges encountered during development and outlines future directions for extending the platform's capabilities. By addressing both current industry needs and anticipating future trends, UtsavMunch aims to set a new standard for digital event management solutions.

## 1. Introduction
The organization and management of events—ranging from weddings and corporate functions to cultural festivals and community gatherings—have traditionally involved complex, time-consuming processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of digital technologies has transformed the event management landscape, enabling organizers and participants to leverage online platforms for enhanced convenience, efficiency, and reach. Despite these advancements, many existing solutions fall short in providing an integrated, user-friendly experience that caters to the diverse needs of all stakeholders involved in event planning and execution.

UtsavMunch was conceived as a response to these challenges, aiming to deliver a holistic event management solution that bridges the gap between event organizers, service vendors, and attendees. The platform offers a centralized hub where users can discover and book a wide array of event services, including venues, catering, photography, entertainment, and decoration. Vendors benefit from increased visibility and streamlined booking management, while administrators are equipped with powerful tools for overseeing platform operations and ensuring compliance with quality standards.

This report delves into the conceptualization, design, and implementation of UtsavMunch, highlighting its innovative features and technical underpinnings. It begins with a review of the current state of event management systems, followed by a detailed analysis of user requirements and system specifications. The document further explores the architectural decisions that shaped the platform, the methodologies employed during development, and the strategies adopted for optimization and evaluation. In addition, the report discusses the anticipated impact of future enhancements, such as integrated chat and payment functionalities, on the overall user experience and platform scalability.

By providing an in-depth examination of UtsavMunch, this report aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of digital event management, demonstrating how thoughtful design and cutting-edge technology can revolutionize the way events are planned and executed.
